# Senior-Project
This is a game for my senior project. It was written in C# and it was made with the Unity game engine.
This requires the Windows operating system to run. Everything that is needed is inside of the zip file, so once it is extracted you can play by running the executable file.

In this game, you play as a coffee deprived armadillo, so naturally you would like to find some of that.
However, your house seems to be missing the ingredients.
There are three levels, and each has its own theme. With each level the player will get weaker without their coffee.
If you are victorious against the boss of a level, an ingredient will be reclaimed and eventually your addiction can be satisfied.
